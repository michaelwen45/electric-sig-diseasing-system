This is the core of the internal company web application system consisting of many different modules automating company processes for the business different stages of business and customer lifecycles. 

These are projects for which I led in the development, software architecture, and product management during my time at REM. You can see Database Schema I designed/architected with <b>120 models</b> can be seen here under <b>app/models</b> which gives insight into the depth and complexity of this project. This software has been decommissioned in favor of real estate software solutions by Yardi.

This code was written between 2014-2017 and demonstrates technical experience experience in many different areas including backend and api development, querying and designing DBs, frontend user interface development, product management and more. Laravel is used as the framework for this project for this project.   <b>Laravel/Querying/DBs/etc</b> while giving a sneak peek of the <b>depth and complexity of work</b> I architected at REM.

I started the software development department at REM and built everything from the ground up after getting offered a full time position as the first software developer at the company. I was able to build this software and grow the department with no development mentorship. Only motivation, determination, hard work, and a lot of self education.

My actual development skills, organizational skills, and knowledge have greatly improved since this code. For a more accurate code quality representation, see my more recent React/Angular/Node repos and other newer projects.
