# REM DB Models

The REM Database Schema I designed/architected with <b>120 models</b> can be seen here under <b>app/models</b> ( current directory ). As a note, this software has been decommissioned as they have moved to yardi.

This code was written between 2014-2017 and demonstrates experience with <b>Laravel/Querying/DBs/etc</b> while giving a sneak peek of the <b>depth and complexity of work</b> I architected at REM. Especially when looking at the data models. 

I started the software development department at REM and built everything from the ground up after getting offered a full time position as the first software developer at the company. I was able to build this software and grow the department with no development mentorship. Only motivation, determination, hard work, and a lot of self education.

My actual development skills, organizational skills, and knowledge have greatly improved since this code. For a more accurate code quality representation, see my more recent React/Angular/Node repos. I have also since learned about NoSQL/document store which would have been awesome for some pieces of this project, but, at the time I did not know it!
